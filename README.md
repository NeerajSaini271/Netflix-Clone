## Responsive Design Notes
- Layout uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for main sections  
- Breakpoints implemented for tablets and mobile screens  
- Images and movie/show cards scale fluidly (`max-width: 100%`, `height: auto`)  
- Text sizes use relative units (`rem`) for better readability on smaller devices
